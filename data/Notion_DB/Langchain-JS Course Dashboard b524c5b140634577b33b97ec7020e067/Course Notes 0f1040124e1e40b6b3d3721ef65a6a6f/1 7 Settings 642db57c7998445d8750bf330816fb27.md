In addition to setting up the environment variables, it's important to monitor and manage your OpenAI API usage to ensure you don't exceed your intended budget. By setting usage limits, you can control your spending and avoid unexpected costs.

To set usage limits, you can navigate to the "Usage" or "Usage Limits" section in your OpenAI account dashboard. From there, you can define your desired limits based on factors such as requests per minute, requests per day, or other relevant metrics. This way, you can have better control over your usage and prevent excessive spending.

By being mindful of your OpenAI API usage and setting appropriate limits, you can safely develop with OpenAI without incurring significant costs.
