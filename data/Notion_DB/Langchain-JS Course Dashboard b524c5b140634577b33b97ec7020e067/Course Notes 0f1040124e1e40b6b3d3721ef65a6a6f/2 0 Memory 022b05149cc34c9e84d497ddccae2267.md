### Overview

In any conversation, memory serves two main purposes - storing and retrieving data. It's like the brain of the conversation. There are two primary methods for this - 'loadMemoryVariables' for retrieving data and 'saveContext' for storing it.

Now, let's dive a little deeper. Memory in conversations can be of two types - short-term and long-term.

Short-term memory is like remembering the context of an ongoing conversation. It usually involves the previous chat messages or summaries of them.

On the other hand, long-term memory helps to fetch and update information between different conversations, similar to recalling a previous discussion.

**There's a key thing to remember: each memory instance represents the history of a single conversation, so it's important not to share the same memory instance between two different chains. Also, if you're deploying your AI application on a serverless environment, don't store memory instances in a variable as it could be reset by your hosting provider**
