## **Troubleshooting**

This section provides various methods to troubleshoot issues that may arise during the course. As the course utilizes cutting-edge technology like Langchain JavaScript, it is essential to have access to relevant resources for effective troubleshooting.

### **Langchain Documentation**

Refer to the official Langchain documentation for JavaScript, which provides valuable information and solutions for common issues. Make sure to use the JS.langchain documentation specifically and not the official documentation, which may focus on Python.

1. Visit the Langchain documentation website for JavaScript.
2. Explore the documentation to find simple use cases, models, prompts, memory agents, and installation instructions.
3. Take advantage of the "Mendable" section, which offers examples and relevant sources for agents and other topics.
4. The documentation also highlights the capabilities and features of Langchain, helping you gain a better understanding of its functionality.

### **AI-Powered Support**

To leverage the power of AI for troubleshooting, consider joining the Langchain JavaScript server and utilizing AI-driven resources.

3. Tag "@kapaAI" in your queries to ensure prompt attention from the AI.
4. Ask questions and describe your issues to receive relevant documentation, step-by-step instructions, and code snippets.
5. The AI on the server is trained on the GitHub repository, providing more comprehensive and specific information compared to general-purpose AI models like ChatGPT.

### **Community Discord Server**

Utilize the Community Discord Server dedicated to the course for additional troubleshooting support.

1. Access the Community Discord Server and navigate to the appropriate channel.
2. Describe your issue or question, providing relevant code snippets or error messages.
3. Use backticks to format your code properly for better readability.
4. Monitor the Discord channel regularly, as the instructor and other participants will respond to your queries.
5. The Discord community is actively engaged, and you can expect prompt responses and assistance.

By leveraging these troubleshooting resources, including Langchain documentation, AI-powered support on the Langchain JavaScript server, and the course's Community Discord Server, you can efficiently resolve issues and overcome challenges encountered during the course.
