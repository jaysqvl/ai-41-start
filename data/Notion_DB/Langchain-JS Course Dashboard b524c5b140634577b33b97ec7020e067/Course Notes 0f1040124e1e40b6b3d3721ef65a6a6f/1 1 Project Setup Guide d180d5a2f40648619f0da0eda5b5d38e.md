## **Introduction**

Welcome to the project setup guide. Here, we'll take you through the steps to get your workspace ready for your coding project.

## **Download and Install Visual Studio Code**

First off, we'll begin with setting up our code editor - Visual Studio Code. This is a popular code editor among developers. You can find all the necessary links in this course curriculum document. To get started:

1. Open Google Chrome and search for 'Visual Studio Code'.
2. Download the version of Visual Studio Code that corresponds with your operating system. It should default to your OS.
3. Install Visual Studio Code on your computer.

## **Setting up Visual Studio Code**

Once you have Visual Studio Code installed, let's get it set up for our project:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a new terminal within Visual Studio Code. It will show you the root directory.
3. Use the command **`cd`** to navigate to your desktop or a folder where you want to work on your project.

## **Install and Verify Node.js**

Next, we will check whether Node.js is installed on your system:

1. In your Visual Studio Code terminal, type **`node -v`**. This command shows you the version of Node.js installed on your computer. If Node.js is installed, it will display the version number (for example, 18.14).
2. If Node.js is not installed or if the version number is lower than 17, you will need to install or upgrade Node.js.

To install or upgrade Node.js:

1. Search for 'Node.js' in Google Chrome.
2. Download the version of Node.js that is suitable for your operating system. Generally, it's recommended to choose the latest stable version, which is a couple versions below the current version.
3. Install Node.js on your computer.
4. Go back to Visual Studio Code and type **`node -v`** in the terminal to verify your installation.

## **Install and Verify Git**

Finally, we will check if Git is installed on your system:

1. In your Visual Studio Code terminal, type **`git --version`**. This command shows you the version of Git installed on your computer. If Git is installed, it will display the version number.
2. If Git is not installed, you will need to install Git.

To install Git:

1. Search for 'Git' in Google Chrome.
2. Follow the download instructions that are relevant to your operating system.
3. Install Git on your computer.
4. Go back to Visual Studio Code and type **`git --version`** in the terminal to verify your installation.

And that concludes the setup guide for your project. If you encounter any issues during any of the installations, don't hesitate to reach out on Discord for help. Happy coding!
